Redmine Project Alias 2
=======================

This plugin lets you create aliases for project identifiers and also lets you use the aliases as main identifier (means: renaming a project identifier and having the old identifier as alias).

This is a git fork of Andriy Lesyuk's [project_alias](http://projects.andriylesyuk.com/projects/project-alias) plugin which seems to be abandoned for a few years now.

*This plugin is listed in the [Redmine plugin directory](https://www.redmine.org/plugins/redmine_project_alias_2)*
